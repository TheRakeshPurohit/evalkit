description: Get started with the EvalKit evaluations framework.

## Installation

EvalKit exports multiple NPM packages.<br />
We'll concentrate on the evaluations framework package, which is available at:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @evalkit/core
```

## Usage of OpenAI

Currently, EvalKit is using OpenAI API in order to perform evaluations.<br />
Therefore, you'll need to set up an OpenAI account and get an API key.<br />

Once you have the API key, you can set it up in your environment variables (`.env` file)

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## Writing your first evaluation

The EvalKit evaluations framework provides a simple API to evaluate text using pre-trained transformer models. Here's a quick example to get you started:

```typescript
import { evaluate, BiasDetectionMetric } from '@evalkit/core';

evaluate({
    // The response (output) by the LLM
	output: "The company prefers to hire young and energetic candidates.",
    // The metrics to use
}, [BiasDetectionMetric, CoherenceMetric])
```
