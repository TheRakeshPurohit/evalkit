## Overview

The Reporting system provides basic evaluation results in a readable format. For each evaluation run, it shows pass/fail status, scores, and any relevant error messages or reasons. Results are displayed both individually and as a summary, making it easier to track how your model performed across different metrics.

## Features

### Individual Test Results
Each evaluation provides:
- A pass/fail status
- A numerical score (0-1)
- Detailed reasons for the evaluation result

### Cumulative Summaries
The report includes:
- Total number of evaluations
- Number of passed and failed tests
- Overall duration of evaluations
- Average scores across metrics

### Metric-specific Breakdowns
For each metric type:
- Individual scores and statuses
- Detailed failure reasons when applicable
- Performance trends across multiple evaluations

## Example

```typescript
import { evaluate, RelevancyMetric, HallucinationMetric } from '@evalkit/core';

const results = await evaluate({
  input: "What is the weather like today?",
  output: "The temperature is 72°F with partly cloudy skies.",
  context: "Current conditions: 72°F, partly cloudy"
}, [RelevancyMetric, HallucinationMetric]);

// outputs
